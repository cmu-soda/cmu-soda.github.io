This project is aimed at improving compositional verification for symbolic specifications.
The core idea is to decompose a symbolic specification into components, which we then *recompose* into components that define an efficient compositional verification problem.
Recomposition is determined by a *recomposition map*; since there are many recomposition maps to choose from, we use heuristics to find a small portfolio of maps which we run in parallel.
In our FMCAD'24 paper, we introduce the notion of recomposition and present a recomposition-based model checker for the TLA+ formal specification language.
