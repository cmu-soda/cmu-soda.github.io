Sumon worked at the intersection of Software Engineering and AI, focusing on design and verification of fairness and safety of ML-enabled systems. He worked on fairness verification of neural networks and modular reasoning of societal bias of predictive decision-making. Additionally, he investigated long-term fairness issues that are exhibited through the interaction between the system and environment. He has also worked on the DARPA project -- Verified Security & Performance Enhancement of Large Legacy Software (V-SPELLS), to model and verify safety of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). 

After working with SoDA, Sumon became an Assistant Professor at Case Western Reserve University.
