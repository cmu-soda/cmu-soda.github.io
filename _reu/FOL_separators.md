__Description and Significance__
First-order logic is used to express system invarients, but it's formal complexity hinders wide-scale adoption.
During debugging of formal expression, *counter-examples* are often used to identify cases that have unexpected behavior for a given invariant.
These examples can be used to identify what is called a *separator* -- an expression that separates positive and negative examples.

__Student Involvement__
Students will use Alloy -- a modeling tool based on first-order and relational logics and transitive closure -- to create a separator when given examples.
The goal of the project is to identify if using formal methods is a viable method for synthesis of a separator.

__Project Results__
One An successfully submitted a Student Research Competition paper to the Automated Software Engineering Conference of 2025 on Folloy - the tool created to synthesize separators in Alloy.
