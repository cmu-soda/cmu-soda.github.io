Our tool for long-term fairness analysis is available [here](https://github.com/cmu-soda/FairSense/).

This artifact contains the source code for the ICSE 2025 paper: "FairSense: Long-Term Fairness Analysis of ML-Enabled Systems". It is composed by two parts: the simulation source code and the sensitivity analysis source code. The experimental results of three case studies presented in the paper can be reproduced using this artifact.
