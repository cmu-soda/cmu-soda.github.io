The guarantees provided by formal verification are only as good as the _assumptions_ that are made about the environment.
Therefore, in prior work, we have proposed _robustness analysis_ to help system designers how robust their guarantees are to environmental _deviations_.
In this project, we lift the notion of robustness to symbolic transition systems in _fault-centered robustness_, in which we calculate safe environmental envelopes based on a user-given set of symbolic faults.
