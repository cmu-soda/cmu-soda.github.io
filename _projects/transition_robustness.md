This project is motivated by the need to design software systems that are safe and robust.
This project offers a *transition-based* definition of software robustness that complements the prior notion of behavioral robustness.
Transition-based robustness identifies the safe environmental envelopes of a system with respect to a given safety property and normative environment.
In our [CAV'23 paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-37706-8_17), we proposed transition-based robustness and used it to analyze cyber-physical systems.
Currently, we are working to extend transition-based robustness to distributed protocols encoded in the TLA+ formal specification language.
