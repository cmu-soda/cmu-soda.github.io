The *Formalization and Automation of STPA with Robustness* (FASR) project uses [robustness](https://cmu-soda.github.io/projects/project_robustness.html) to partially automate the [*System Theoretic Process Analysis*](https://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/JThomas-STPA-Introduction.pdf) (STPA).

Users model critical portions of their system in [SysML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_modeling_language) with the [Cameo Enterprise Architect](https://www.3ds.com/products/catia/no-magic/cameo-enterprise-architecture) modeling environment. Then the FASR tool translates the models to [TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html), uses CMU SoDA's [Fortis](https://github.com/cmu-soda/fortis-core) to analyze their robustness, classifies the output, and reports back any Unsafe Control Actions to the user. This reporting takes place in Cameo EA, and uses the recent [RAAML](https://www.omg.org/spec/RAAML/) standardized hazard analysis format.

*Tools:*

* [Fortis](https://github.com/cmu-soda/fortis-core/tree/FASR) (be sure to use the FASR branch)
